# Module 4 - Introduction to DHIS2 Customization (6 hr)

## 4.0 Overview of the module (10 min)

## What is in this module

Now that you’ve had the opportunity to use DHIS2 with existing data, we would like to shift focus and show you how to set up DHIS2 to capture your own data. You’ll start by reviewing the **Design Principles** of DHIS2 so you can understand how DHIS2 works behind the scenes. Then, after watching demonstrations, you will  create **Organisation Units,**also known as our “where” dimension**. Organisation Units** form the backbone of data collection as they associate all of the data you are capturing with a particular location. You will be able to create these in a new training environment, **DHIS2 Customization**. Next, you’ll look at how to create **Data Elements**(our**“**what”****dimension) These data elements define exactly what information we want to capture. After you have reviewed the creation of organisation units and data elements, you will review the various **Data Collection**mechanisms available in DHIS2. ****Finally, you’ll look at **Data Sets**within DHIS2**. Data Sets** are a collection of data elements and are assigned to certain organisation units. These are conceptually similar to a paper data collection form. You will have the opportunity to create a data set within the DHIS2 Customization training environment.

This module is graded, and successfully completing the module is required in order for you to gain your Fundamentals Certificate. This is because all of the Level 1 DHIS2 academies have some aspects of configuration or maintenance within their course content, so a basic understanding of this material is required for participation in those courses. The grading for this module is made up of **5 quizzes that each make up 5%** of your grade, in subsections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 & 4.6.****There are also **3 assignments that each make up 8%** of your grade in subsections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.6 that need to be completed within the DHIS2 Customization training environment.

To make the most out of your learning experience, we recommend that you complete this module within a week of starting it.  

## 4.1 - Introduction to Collection and Customization (20 min)

### Video - Collection and Customization Intro (3 min)

In this introductory video, you will review the concepts that we will be focusing on within this module. In this module, you will learn how to create your own sets of Organisation Units, Data Elements and Data Sets.

You will also review how to use the Web Data Entry App, the Android Data Capture App, SMS and PDF and other import options to upload data to DHIS2. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqc-O4Z0dP8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqc-O4Z0dP8)

#### Session Quiz - DHIS2 Customization (10 min)

1. DHIS2 is an off-the-shelf solution that requires no additional configuration upon installation.

* True
* False

EXPLANATION

In both the DHIS2 History/Introduction and DHIS2 design principles presentation, it is highlighted that DHIS2 is a generic solution that needs to be tailored to fit local needs and requirements

2. You need to be a computer programmer (someone who knows computer languages) to take part in the configuration of DHIS2.

* True
* False

EXPLANATION

Many aspects of DHIS2 configuration can take place directly through the user-interface. This concept was discussed in the DHIS2 design principles presentation and demonstrated through numerous configuration sessions.

3. DHIS2 only supports the integration of data from one health program at a time.

* True
* False

EXPLANATION

Multiple programs can be integrated into the DHIS2 platform together. This is shown as both a concept and demo in the DHIS2 design principles session.

4. Reports in DHIS2 are dynamic and can be the combination of data from several different data sources.

* True
* False

EXPLANATION

Report can be a combination of data from multiple sources. This is shown in the DHIS2 design principles session.

5. What is the difference between Data Elements and Indicators (select one)?

* They are both the same.
* Data Elements measure the coverage while indicators collects data values from the paper forms
* Data Elements are the raw data while Indicators are calculated values/formulas

EXPLANATION

The key difference here is that indicators represent calculated values, and can typically be made up of several data elements. Data elements are the raw items of data that are collected through routine processes.

## 4.3 - Organisation Units

### Video - Organisation Units Presentation (6 min)

In this video, you’ll be introduced to the  concepts of **organisation units, organisation unit groups** and **organisation unit group sets.**These form the backbone of our data collection as they assist in attaching geographical locations to each data item that is stored in the system. Some best practices in their management are introduced before discussing their creation in the next series of videos. ****[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge5LjORD9Lg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge5LjORD9Lg)

### Video - Organisation Units Demo - Part 1 of 4 (15 min)

After understanding how organisation units, organisation unit groups, and organisation unit group sets are related, you will now learn **how organisation units are created within DHIS2**. This will also include an introduction to the maintenance app, which allows you to create various items (referred to as metadata) within DHIS2.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmuI6BNUvho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmuI6BNUvho)

### Video - Organisation Units Demo - Part 2 of 4 (7 min)

In this video, you will learn how to take the organisation units you have created and group them into **organisation unit groups**.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb0hhs9dkj4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb0hhs9dkj4)

### Video - Organisation Units Demo - Part 3 of 4 (4 min)

Once you have created your organisation units and grouped them using organisation unit groups, you can take on the last step, creating **organisation unit group sets.** This video will cover this last step. These 3 concepts combined can have a significant impact on how your data is stored (as defined by the**organisation units** themselves) and what types of outputs are possible (as **organisation unit groups**and **group sets** allow you to disaggregate your data depending on how they have been defined).

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwOx2qH_ClM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwOx2qH_ClM)

### Video - Organisation Units Demo - Part 4 of 4 (4 min)

To finish this session, watch this video summarizing how to create Organisation Units, Organisation Unit Groups and Organisation Group Sets. .

## Assignment - Organisation Units, Data Elements & Data Sets

### NOTE: These graded assignments belong to a series that goes throughout module 4. (30 min)

This series of assignments consist of 3 sets and makes up **8% of your overall grade.**

*
Set 1: Organisation Units

*
Set 2: Data Elements

*
Set 3: Data Sets
At the end of the last assignment (assignment 4.6.2) you will be asked to check whether you have completed the whole series of assignments or not. This check will allow the course team to validate the result of your assignments in the DHIS2 Customization training environment. It is only after this validation process that the final grade of this series of assignments will be confirmed. As with all other assignments, you are allowed 3 attempts to complete this assignment successfully.

Note: Before validation from the course team has been performed, the maximum grade for this series will be applied to your progress automatically. This unvalidated grade is only a placeholder value, and may change once the validation process is complete.

#### Assignments Module 4 - Set 1/3 - Organisation Units

Instructions

You need to be logged in [DHIS2 Customisation](https://live.academy.dhis2.org/cu1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action) to perform the following assignments.

You are tasked with creating a portion of the organisation unit hierarchy within your country. The data should be entered at the correct level so appropriate outputs can be created. The hierarchy in this example country has 4 levels:

1. Country
2. Province
3. District
4. Facility

You will notice that the Country level organisation unit has been created using your email address when you enter organisation unit maintenance. This is so that you will only see the organisation units that you are creating, rather than seeing everyone’s organisation units together. Feel free to change the name of this organisation unit to something else if you desire.

![alt_text](images/image140.png "image_tooltip")

Please work on the following:

#### Assignment 4.3.1

Define and create the organisation unit.

Refer to the doc "[Exercise Worksheet - Creating Organisation unit](https://academy.dhis2.org/assets/courseware/0bc4e40bbec535044faf30bd8ffdcbd0/c4x/HISP/DHIS2_Level1/asset/Exercise_Worksheet_-_Creating_Organisation_units.pdf)". Create organisation units with the following organisation unit hierarchy.

* 1 org unit at level 2 (Province)
* 3 org units at level 3 (District)
* 9 org units at level 4 (Facility)

#### Assignment 4.3.2

Create 4 organisation unit groups with the following names (and belonging to the indicated group sets) and assign your above facilities (the organisation units you have made at level 4) appropriately:

Note: Make sure to add a prefix using your initials to these names (ie. SND_Hospital, SND_Health Center) when you create them in DHIS2. As everyone is creating items in the same system, you need to provide the groups with unique names.

Group Set 1 : Facility Type

* Hospital
* Health center

Group Set 2 : Ownership

* Private
* Public

#### Assignment 4.3.3

Create two organisation unit group sets and assign them the appropriate organisation unit groups:

Note: Make sure to add a prefix using your initials to these names (ie. SND_Type, SND_Ownership) when you create them in DHIS2. As everyone is creating items in the same system, you need to provide the group sets with unique names.

* Type
* Ownership

## Session Quiz - Organisation Units

Session Quiz - Organisation Units (20 min)  

This is a graded quiz and it is worth 5% of your final grade. You have 3 attempts to pass this quiz.

Select the "check" button to submit your answers.

If you want to save your current response without submitting it for grading, select the "save" button. This will allow you to come back later and resume the previously saved attempt.

#### Session Quiz - Organisation Units

1. Which one of these is not an organisation unit? (select one)

* Ermita Public Health Centre
* National Capital Region
* Manila Hospital
* Malaria Elimination Project

EXPLANATION

In the organisation units presentation, it is mentioned that multiple concepts should not be mixed in the hierarchy

2. The organisation unit hierarchy: (select one)

* Can use organisation unit groups to model additional hierarchies (for example, public/private facilities) for analysis
* Only supports a limited number of levels
* Does not include any administrative layers outside of the facility

EXPLANATION

The concept of using organisation unit groups during analysis was shown during the organisation units presentation. These are user defined as was shown in the organisation unit demo.

Imagine you've created the following health facilities in DHIS2:

-Alberta Public Health Clinic

-Ontario Private Hospital

-Windsor Public Health Clinic

-London Public Hospital

As you can see there are two ownership types: private and public. There are also two facility types: clinic and hospital.

Now you want to create organisation units groups for these facilities.

3. Which organisation unit groups would be best? (Select one or more)

* Health Clinic: Alberta Public Health Clinic / Windsor Public Health Clinic AND Hospital: Ontario Private Hospital / London Public Hospital / Windsor Public Health Clinic
* Health Clinic: Alberta Public Health Clinic / Windsor Public Health Clinic AND Hospital: Ontario Private Hospital / London Public Hospital
* Publicly Owned Facilities: Alberta Public Health Clinic / Windsor Public Health Clinic / London Public Hospital AND Privately Owned Facilities: Ontario Private Hospital
* Publicly Owned Facilities: Windsor Public Health Clinic / London Public Hospital AND Privately Owned Facilities: Ontario Private Hospital / Alberta Public Health Clinic

EXPLANATION

In this case, we can group the public health clinics and hospitals together. This would be equivalent to defining the type of facility within a system. We can also group public and private facilities together, which would be equivalent to defining the ownership of these facilities. This was discussed during the organisation unit presentation.

4. When managing organisation units in DHIS2 through the user interface, we can define the following geographical features: (select one or more)

* Latitude/Longitude (for example, the location of a facility)
* Geographical Symbols that define groups
* Geographical Boundaries for regions, provinces, districts, etc.

EXPLANATION

This was shown when demoing the creation of organisation units. We can add in lat/long coordinates of a facility during creation, and assign symbols to organisation unit groups.

## 4.4 - Data Elements

### Video - Data Elements Design Principles  (12 min)

In this video, you will review the different types of data that can be collected in DHIS2, including what we refer to as  routine, semi-permanent and infrastructure data. You will also understand why it is important to **name data elements correctly;**this will include a review of best practices to follow when naming your data elements****. Lastly, you’ll see how to create data element groups and group sets.

## Session Quiz - Data Elements

### Session Quiz - Data Elements (20 min)

This is a graded quiz and is worth 5% of your final grade.

You have 3 attempts to pass this quiz.

Select the "check" button to submit your answers.

If you want to save your current response without submitting it for grading, select the "save" button. This allows you to come back later and resume the previously saved attempt.

#### Session Quiz - Data Elements

1. Data Element names should: (select one)

* Be as long and descriptive as possible
* Use self-contained names which describe the data effectively for output
* Replicate the name on a paper form
* Be considered for input as a priority

EXPLANATION

When discussing data elements, we should always consider how they will appear in output. This is discussed in more detail during the data elements presentation.

2. I have a section of data elements that I am collecting all related to child delivery. I want to create the data element represented by the "Number of deliveries with complication" on the paper form. What is the most appropriate name for this data element? (select one)

* Number of deliveries with complication
* Complicated deliveries
* Deliveries with complication

EXPLANATION

During the data element presentation, naming principles were discussed. Here, since we have a set of delivery data elements, it is better to start the name off with "Delivery" as all the delivery types could easily be found together in a list.

3. Data elements in DHIS2 can only be summed (added) together. No other operations, such as finding the average or counts of a particular value, can be performed.

* True
* False

EXPLANATION

When creating data elements, we can define various aggregation types. While sum tends to be a common option, other types can be used if needed.

4. Data Element Groups are used for grouping together similar data elements for thematic analysis.

* True
* False

EXPLANATION

Data element groups are user defined and assist us in finding our data elements during analysis. Their use was shown throughout all the analysis apps and their creation was shown in the data element creation session.

## 4.5 - Data Collection

### Video - Data Collection Presentation (13 min)

The previous sets of assignments have allowed you to practice creating organisation units and data elements. Prior to creating a data set, we will demonstrate the different options that allow you to bring data into DHIS2, including the Data Entry Web application, the Android Data capture App, SMS Data Entry, PDF Data Upload, and Manual Data Import. The data entry web app, android data capture app and SMS data entry all use the concept of a dataset, which we will show you how to create after you have reviewed various data collection mechanisms in more detail.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onVutn5y9Q0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onVutn5y9Q0)

### Video - Data Collection - Web - Part 1 of 5 (5 min)

In this video, you’ll learn how to input data into DHIS2 using the Data Entry Web application. We will use the 3 building blocks in this session, selecting **Where**the data is entered, **When**the data is entered, and **What**data is being entered.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIeWvibXZOw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIeWvibXZOw)

#### Activity 1 - Introducing the data entry app interface

Please do this activity in [TRAININGLAND](https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action).

Familiarize yourself with the web data entry interface by opening a data set, navigating the data set and entering some data values. In order to open a data set you must first select the organisation unit, data set and period that you would like to review.

* Select any organisation unit by either using the magnifying glass or expanding the tree on the left side of the screen.

<p id="gdcalert141" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image141.png).

### Video - Data Collection - Web Demo - Part 2 of 5 (7 min)

In this video, you will see some additional options available when entering values using the Data Entry Web App. This includes checking the internal consistency of your data values through reviewing historical values as well as using a concept called validation rules and reviewing what changes have been made to your data using the audit trail.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aq5SN-nCYpM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aq5SN-nCYpM)

### Activity 2 - Reviewing the data element history, audit trail and validation rules

Please do this activity in [TRAININGLAND](https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action).

Start this activity by running validation for the data that you have previously entered according to the example data provided in Activity 1:

* You can select "Run validation" at either the top or bottom of the data entry page.

<p id="gdcalert145" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image145.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert146">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

![alt_text](images/image145.png "image_tooltip")

When you run validation, a pop-up screen will prompt you that some validation rule violations have been detected.

<p id="gdcalert146" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image146.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert147">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

![alt_text](images/image146.png "image_tooltip")

This includes:

* Birth live >= Breastfeeding within 1 hour after delivery: the amount of infants that are breastfeed within 1 hour after delivery is a subset of the total live births within a facility. Therefore live births should always be greater than or equal to the number of infants breastfeed within 1 hour after delivery.
* Delivery by Caesarean Section &lt;= Delivery by skilled birth attendant: Caesarean Sections are a subset of total deliveries performed by a skilled birth attendant, and therefore should be less than or equal to the deliveries performed by a skilled birth attendant.
* Delivery with complication &lt;= Delivery by skilled birth attendant: Deliveries with complication are a subset of total deliveries performed by a skilled birth attendant, and therefore should be less than or equal to the deliveries performed by a skilled birth attendant.

Let us fix these validation rules before continuing.

* Update the following data elements to fix the issues with validation. In this case, we could imagine some simple data entry errors occurring. In the first example (Birth live) a 6 was entered instead of a 9. In the second example (Delivery by skilled birth attendant) the 7 was not entered at the end of the data value.

<p id="gdcalert147" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image147.png).

![alt_text](images/image147.png "image_tooltip")

After you have edited the values:

* run the validation again. This time, you should see a successful result.

![alt_text](images/image148.png "image_tooltip")

* Double click on the value for Birth live (194) after you have corrected it.

This will bring up the data history page for you to review.

#### Session Quiz - Data Collection

1. The main function of Data Sets in DHIS2 is to: (select one)

* Create dynamic outputs
* Group together data elements for analysis
* Capture Data
* Analyse data quality

EXPLANATION

Data Sets are used to capture data from different sources in DHIS2. Outputs are not directly tied to data sets and can be a mix of different data sets as needed.

2. Some different methods for me to input data using DHIS2 include: (select one or more)

* Performing a manual import of data
* Using an Android Device
* Scanning Data directly from a paper form
* Using the data entry app within DHIS2

EXPLANATION

Different types of data collection methods were shown throughout Module 4. DHIS2 does not have the ability to scan in results from a paper form directly however.

3. In the web data entry app, you can view the following: (select one or more)

* Data element history (referring to the history of a particular item)
* Audit trail (showing you changes made to a particular item)
* The distribution of the data over a particular period, such as variance or standard deviation

EXPLANATION

DHIS2 does allow for you to examine data distributions such as variance and standard deviation, but this cannot be done directly in the data entry web app. The audit trail and data element history were shown in the data entry web app session.

4. In the web data entry app what type of quick quality checks can be performed? (select one or more)

* That individual minimum and maximum limits are not violated
* Validation rules that run user defined conditions which check that certain logical, mathematical criteria are met
* That values are being entered in the correct format (ie. text cannot be entered in a numerical field)

EXPLANATION

In the web data entry app, various quality checks can be run while entering data. These were shown in the data entry web app session.

5. Android Data Entry can be performed offline without an internet connection

* True
* False

EXPLANATION

As long as you are logged in to the Android app (and do not log out) and you can continue to enter data directly on the Android device without an internet connection.

6. Alternative methods of bringing data into DHIS2, such as importing the data or using PDF files, are possible

* True
* False

EXPLANATION

Other methods of bringing data into DHIS2 are possible. This allows for transferring data from legacy systems or creating a data warehouse with data that is in different formats.

## Assignment - Organisation Units, Data Elements & Data Sets

### NOTE: These graded assignments belong to a series that goes throughout module 4. (30 min)

This series of assignments consist of 3 sets:

* Set 1: Organisation Units
* Set 2: Data Elements
* **Set 3: Data Sets**

At the end of the last assignment (assignment 4.6.2 - included in this section of the module) you will be asked to check whether you have completed the whole series of assignments or not. This check will allow the course team members to validate the result of your assignments in the DHIS2 Customization training environment. It is only after this validation process that the final grade of this series of assignments will be confirmed. As with all for the other assignments, you are allowed 3 attempts to complete this assignment successfully..

_Note: Before validation from the course team has been performed, the maximum grade for this series will be applied to your progress automatically. This unvalidated grade is only a placeholder value, and may change once the validation process is complete._

#### Assignments Module 4 - Set 3/3 - Data Sets

Instructions

You need to be logged in [DHIS2 Customization](https://live.academy.dhis2.org/cu1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action) to perform the following assignments.

Data Set Example

In the data element section you were provided with the following example data set.

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Data Element
   </td>
   <td>Value
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Number of female sex workers reached with HIV prevention programs (Outreach)
   </td>
   <td>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Number of PLHIV Attended
   </td>
   <td>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Number of HIV positive TB patients who are already on ART or started on ART during TB treatment
   </td>
   <td>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>TB07.10 Number of patients with positive bacteriological results out of diagnosis
   </td>
   <td>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>TB07.19 Number of patients examined for follow-up
   </td>
   <td>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>MAL02.01 Malaria Slide (Tested)
   </td>
   <td>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Assignment 4.6.1 - Create a default data set

Part 1

Using the data elements you have already created in the data element exercise, recreate this data set as a monthly data set collected at the facility level (assign the data set to the facilities you have created). Note that the Data set has already been created for you when you created your account. You can edit it and provide it with a better name if desired. You will need to edit the data sets properties, add the data elements that you have created to this data set and assign it to an organisation unit. This is to get around the issue of managing user privileges that was discussed in the video demonstration, as this data set is by default assigned to your user.

<p id="gdcalert182" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image182.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert183">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

![alt_text](images/image182.png "image_tooltip")
